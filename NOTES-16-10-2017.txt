segments.py
***********
Added getPromptsLocally so that we can run getPrompts on all the
individual directories from the GALE data and save the results in a
set of directories inside <dest>, e.g.

>>> getPromptsLocally(dest="XXX", runMadamira=True, N=1000)

will copy 1000 segments from the standard GALE location
(i.e.'/Users/ramsay/ASIM/DATASETS/gale_p3_ara_bn_transcripts_p1/data/tdf'
for me, somewhere else for you) into a set of directories inside XXX.

On the way, I fixed getPrompts so it used the right directory for the
source when running Madamira.

mada.py
*******
Fixed it so that we calculate all the things we want to know about
unknowns in one place (getUnknowns, getAllUnknowns) and write them
somewhere else (saveUnknowns). Previous version did both in one place,
which is always a bad idea.

""" 
Get all the unknowns in all the directories that you just created in XXX
"""
>>> madaunknowns, samaunknowns, sentences = getAllUnknowns("XXX")
"""
Save the result of doing that in "unknowns.csv"
"""
>>> saveUnknowns(madaunknowns, samaunknowns, out="unknowns.csv")
