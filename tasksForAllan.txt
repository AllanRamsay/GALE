Make sure it all runs

Package madamira up so we can call it as part of a script

Write README.tx

Find counts of unknown word types and unknown word tokens for SAMA
(and MADAMIRA, but surely they'll be the same). Optionally, generated
.csv file contains only unrecognised words, and actually contains them
each one with a count rather than lots of times.

We can't use segments to generate one great big file, because MADAMIRA
can't cope with great big files. But if we generate one file per GALE
datafile, then our search for unknown words has to recursively scan
each of these.

Fix SAMA so that it tries W and I for unrecognised words that start
with A or AlA (or wAlA, but no others). (make that optional, then Iman
can decide: in the HTK script, we might want to try SAMA by itself, in
which case letting it fail on these cases is fine, but if we're using
it in support of MADAMIRA then it would be silly not to let it get
these ones right).

What is a dash? Make it a short pause? But we'll have to make sure
that it gets treated properly (i.e. left untouched) by the
assimilation rules.


Extract results as .csv so we can plot graphs

Make segments look for gender
