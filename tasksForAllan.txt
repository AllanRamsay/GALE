Make sure it all runs

Package madamira up so we can call it as part of a script
DONE

Write README.tx

Find counts of unknown word types and unknown word tokens for SAMA
(and MADAMIRA, but surely they'll be the same). Optionally, generated
.csv file contains only unrecognised words, and actually contains them
each one with a count rather than lots of times.
DONE

We can't use segments to generate one great big file, because MADAMIRA
can't cope with great big files. But if we generate one file per GALE
datafile, then our search for unknown words has to recursively scan
each of these.
DONE

Fix SAMA so that it tries W and I for unrecognised words that start
with A or AlA (or wAlA, but no others). (make that optional, then Iman
can decide: in the HTK script, we might want to try SAMA by itself, in
which case letting it fail on these cases is fine, but if we're using
it in support of MADAMIRA then it would be silly not to let it get
these ones right).
DONE

What is a dash? Make it a short pause? But we'll have to make sure
that it gets treated properly (i.e. left untouched) by the
assimilation rules.
For Iman: but first we have to put a version of HARMONY on
GitHub. Iman has made some changes, I haven't. So her version should
go there, and then one of us (I think it should be Iman, she may not)
adds dash to sounds.pl as something which is neither a vowel nor a
consonant. 

Fix segments so that it includes the gender (and name?) of the speaker
in the prompt name.

Do an end-to-end test with (a) a folder full of subfolders and (b) a
single file.


Extract results as .csv so we can plot graphs

Make segments look for gender
