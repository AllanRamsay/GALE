We had a problem with

sentence("*/test-SYRIANTV_NEWS25_ARB_20070403_162800-102", "bwrAl
Allayyu bsvHymsvl raqman xamsapan wEsvXsvryn waHAwil fyhA mannan
nAHiyapan AlyasAru")

because there is a rule that wants to keep re-applying itself. It's
the "Al Allayu" that causes the problem -- it's OK if I manually
substitute "Al Alayyu", other instances of "...All..." don't cause a
problem.

The original generation of these things included "ii", "uu", "aA". I
had to substitute "y", "w", "A" for them: which is pretty stupid,
because I then just re-recognise them as "ii" and "uu".
